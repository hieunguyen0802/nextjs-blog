It was a normal day like others. I was on my way back home after finishing classes at community colleges. The scholarship could come at anytime, which means I can be rejected or accepted. Joining me on every road is my phone connected to car audio in order to bring me good vibes when driving. Yet it does not matter which songs were playing, I felt so dark. There was no such thing that could boost up my spriit except an email from admission staff to inform me about my scholarship.

Whatever comes will come. There was only a traffic light left before I arrived home. The sounds and noftifications from my phone caught my attentions. I swiped down to check and here it is, an email from admission lady...

... I read it. My eyes were on the subject line: 
" Congratulations from TCU, Hieu 110326204 "

There are no words that can describe my feelings at that time. Definitely, I was happy, but I did not laugh because I was also waiting for my scholarship. I rolled my eyes down to the email's body, where said
 "Iâ€™m writing to let you know that you have been awarded a TCU Scholarship in the amount of $12,000 per year. You have been awarded with an international financial aid grant in the amount of $30,580 per year.  That is in addition to the $12,000 scholarship you already received, so your total award will be $42,580 per year.  Congratulations! "

 This feeling give me goosebumps whenever I flashed back. I was so delighted and bursted into tears when I told my parents. This was absolutely a perfect gift for them for Chirstmas Eve.

 I was happy
