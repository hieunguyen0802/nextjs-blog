I love America because of the freedom that we obtain. We can do what we please without being criticized by our decisions. We have the chioce of being what we want to be and how we become that person. America gives us the opportunity not to hide from the things that we believe in.

I love America for the rights that she gives us,especially the right to make decisions and be ourselves. We have more right than any other country and yet we do take things for granted, but then there are some of us that realize what our country stands for. Our country stands for God.             

I love America for all the beauty that she beholds. We get to see the beauty of America everyday and are able to cherish it. There are so many places in America that none of us have ever seen. One day we will get the privilege of knowing our country and to see how beautiful it actually is.

I love America because the people in America is what has made her so beautiful. There are people who have done so much to make her a free country and they have succeded. America has been through many hardships but has always managed to come out shining.
             
I love America because of how strong she is. She has stood through terrorists trying to tear her down. She has given everyone in this country a resaon to love her. I believe that even though there are things wrong with America, that if we work together we could come out on top in every aspect.
