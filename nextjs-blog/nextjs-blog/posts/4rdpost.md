I think first time when I was super happy about being able to build something on my own was high school. During one of Informatics classes teacher introduced QBasic to us. We were practicing it and I decided to solve one of his tasks he prepared for us. It took me quite some time (and a lot of lines of code) but in the end it worked! I showed it to him, and he quickly made changes: my code was rewritten to just few lines. I cannot remember why I didn't continue back then. What I remember though is the fact that I was considering choosing mathematics as one of the exams for my secondary school certificate, but in the end, I picked geography. Why? I discussed my plans with one of my teachers and I heard from her: "you better go with geography; it will be easier".

I was already actively using Twitter at the time I decided "I want to learn how to code!" and I think thanks to it I found out about Codecademy. Based on my experience I can highly recommend it and together with freeCodeCamp they're just perfect (in my opinion ;) for all beginners. They are free and user friendly: you do not have to install anything; you just log in into your account and write code directly there!

At some point I felt that it would be good to try something else. Thanks to social media (again:) I learnt about Udacity. I decided to give it a try and it was very good decision: while Codecademy was mostly about reading text and doing tasks, here you have videos with topics being explained by industry experts. Depending on language you want to learn or "path" you want complete you might be doing some coding on their website or using your IDE. There is a lot of free content available, but they also have some paid Nanodegree programs.

They offer a lot of courses - the trick is everyone can create content and become "an expert". I would recommend you do some search online before investing money (even if it is only 10 euro) into something that might be not worth it.

Thanks to being part of #100DaysOfCode, #301DaysOfCode, #WomenInTech community on Twitter I was able to select great courses. When I started feeling more comfortable with coding and wanted to finally understand Algorithms and Data Structures, I bought "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass" course by Colt Steele. I finished it long time ago, but as I want to refresh my knowledge will be going through it again soon.
