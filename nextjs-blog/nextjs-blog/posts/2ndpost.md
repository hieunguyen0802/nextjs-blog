I received my flight back home ticket on September 14, 2020 at 12:14am.

Now I am at the airport ready for the flight. 

So it is the end of my 7 years journey in America.

There were lots of memories and plenty of laughs. 

I treasured them all. I wish time either has wings so it can fly back or is a machine that can reverse.

Time flied and it also brings everything towards. 

Leave nothing left but your memories and loves

I will sure miss my America and I will not ever forget everything I had during time I was here.

Until I see you again, I love you !
